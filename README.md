## Combination Calculator

This program is designed to calculate the combination of two numbers, `n` and `k`, based on the formula:

```
nCk = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable file generated after compilation.

## Input

When you run the program, you will be prompted to input two integers, `n` and `k`, which are the parameters required for the calculation.

```bash
n = [Enter a positive integer]
k = [Enter a positive integer]
```

## Output

The program will then display the formula used for the calculation, as well as the total possible combinations:

```yaml
Formula: nCk = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
Total possible combinations: [Result of the calculation]
```

## How It Works

1. The program takes user input for integers `n` and `k`.
2. It then calculates the combination using the provided formula and displays the total possible combinations.

## Example

Let's go through a quick example:

```
n = 5
k = 2

Formula: 5C2 = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!)

Total possible combinations: 10
```


## About the Developer

This Combination Calculator project was developed as part of a math journey. The purpose of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of combinations and factorials in mathematics.
